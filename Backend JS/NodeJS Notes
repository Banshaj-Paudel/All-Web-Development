NodeJS Notes

Import all the required libraries using "require("library name")" and assign it into a variable, 

npm init : always use this before starting any project to create dependencies and initiate node package manager

Install the required packages for the current project, using npm install <package_name>

We have to set the template engine to pug.!!
Create a folder named "views" to store all the templates
After setting the template engine, we have to set the directory path for the directory containing all 
the template engine

Create a folder named "static" to store static files that are to be served.
set the path and the directory that has static files which are to be served.

set the listening port for the server.(the port where it will be listened{80, 8000, 5000}.Our Domain 
will be localhost or 127.0.0.1)

The templates which we use to preview in the website, we keep them inside the views folder which we 
made earlier for storing our templates. To show these static files, we use app.render, or else the 
file will be presented as it is, but we want it to be rendered.

Now about the templates, we only have to learn about the syntax for writing HTML in the PUG template 
style since CSS and JS files will only be included. We will name our index file as index.pug and it will be inside the views folder because it is a template file and our other files like CSS, JS scripts, images and other media will be in the static folder.

For every new endpoint we will have to change the html file(index.pug) by creating a new one which 
means it will have new Static files.
